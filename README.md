# Amanda Brown's homework 01 

This is my **first** time creating a repository on Github. Feeling good so far!

## A little about me

I have been using R for about a year and a half in the context of my own research. I was thrown into it at first working on a complex experiment collecting and analyzing motion capture data from the hand movements of English speakers and ASL signers. My colleague, who had a computer science background, created a custom R package to process and even analyze some of our data, but when he abruptly left the University I was left on my own to learn how to use and edit his packages to accomodate changes in our research design. Fast forward a year or so, and quite a lot of trial and error, I feel somewhat confident using R and writing some pograms, but I have never had any formal instruction in proper computing practice, never really knew what a "workflow" was, and thought Github was a nightmare to navigate (until this afternoon). 

Here are some basic facts about my graduate career. I am...

- a PhD Student in Comparative Human Development
- in my 5th year of study
- Planning to graduate in August 2019
- Looking to complete the Computational Social Science Certificate next year

## About my process

In order to complete this assignment I first followed all of the installation instructions carefully, and had little trouble getting my system set up. I had never "forked" a repository before, but I was delighted that it was so easy. After cloning the repository, I had fun learning the Markdown syntax from [this helpful link](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).
